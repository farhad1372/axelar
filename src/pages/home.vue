      <p>
        Axelar delivers secure cross-chain communication for Web3, enabling you
        to build Interchain dApps that grow beyond a single chain. Secure means
        Axelar is built on proof-of-stake, the battle-tested approach used by
        Ethereum, Polygon, Cosmos, and more. Cross-chain communication means you
        can build a complete experience for your users that lets them interact
        with any asset, any application, on any chain with one click.
      </p>

      <p>
        Proof-of-Stake security <br />
        Most cross-chain solutions are permissioned multisigs. Axelar network
        security is based on delegated proof-of-stake, which means a dynamic
        validator set using similar consensus to the networks Axelar connects.
        Axelar has built permissionless technology that enables a path toward
        decentralization.
      </p>

      <p>
        Uniform architecture <br />
        Demand for cross-chain transactions has spawned ad-hoc bridges that
        weaken security and limit interoperability. Axelar uses permissionless
        protocols, the Cross-Chain Gateway Protocol (CGP, analogous to Border
        Gateway Protocol) and the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CTP, analogous
        to File Transfer Protocol) to provide uniform security, translation and
        routing across any two connected chains.
